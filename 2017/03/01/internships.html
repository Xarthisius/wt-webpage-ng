    <p>The Whole Tale is inviting Internship applications for 2017!</p>
<p>Scholarly publications are often disconnected from the underlying data and code
that was used to produce the findings. There is no shortage of tools and
cyberinfrastructure (CI) addressing specific aspects of this challenge, yet
scientists find it difficult to utilize these different pieces and building
blocks in a seamless way that spans the “whole story”, i.e., from conducting
the computational science to the publication of a “living” or executable
paper. These new types of publications include not only the science narrative,
but also (references to) all the relevant data, code, and provenance
information needed to reproduce and experience the computational and research
processes described by the paper.</p>
<p>Whole Tale: <em>Merging Science and Cyberinfrastructure Pathways</em> is an NSF-funded
project that will enable researchers to examine, transform and then seamlessly
re-publish research data that was used in an article. As a result, these
"living articles" enable new discovery by allowing researchers to construct
representations and syntheses of data. Whole Tale is a collaboration led by the
University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in collaboration with partners at the
University of Chicago, the University of Texas at Austin, the University of
California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Notre Dame. We are pleased to
announce the availability of summer research internships for undergraduates,
graduate students and recent postgraduates!</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>March 27</strong> - Application period opens</li>
<li><strong>April 14 (CLOSED)</strong> - Deadline for receipt of applications</li>
<li><strong>Apr 25-28</strong> - Notification of acceptance </li>
<li><strong>May 22</strong> - Program begins</li>
<li><strong>June 19</strong> - Midterm evaluations</li>
<li><strong>July 21</strong> - Program concludes</li>
</ul>
<p>Some allowance will be made for students who are unavailable during these dates
due to their school calendar</p>
<h3>Program Information</h3>
<p>Interns undertake a 9-week program of work centered around one of the projects
listed below. Each intern will be paired with one or more mentors. Interns need
not necessarily be at the same location or institution as any of their mentors.
Interns and mentors are expected to have a virtual or face-to-face meeting at
the beginning of the summer, maintain frequent communication throughout the
program and interns are required to keep an online notebook.</p>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>The program is open to undergraduate students, graduate students, and
postgraduates who have received their degree within the past five years. There
are no restrictions on academic backgrounds or field of study (but see details
below). Interns must be at least 18 years of age by the program start date,
<strong>must be currently enrolled or employed at a U.S. university or other research
institution and must currently reside in, and be eligible to work in, the
United States</strong>. Interns are expected to be available approximately 40
hours/week during the internship period with significant availability during
the normal business hours.</p>
<h3>Financial Support</h3>
<p>Interns will receive a stipend of $5,000 for participation, paid in two
installments (one at the midterm and one at the conclusion of the program). In
addition, if travel to a project meeting is necessary, required travel expenses
will be borne by the Whole Tale project. Participation in the program after the
mid-term is contingent on satisfactory performance. The University of Illinois,
Urbana-Champaign will administer funds. Interns will need to supply their own
computing equipment and internet connection. For students who are not US
citizens or permanent residents, complete visa information will be required,
and it may be necessary for the funds to be paid through the student’s
university or research institution. In such cases, the student will need to
provide the necessary contact information for their organization.</p>

<h4>Project #1: Online Materials Science Modeling and Analytics</h4>
<p><strong>Primary Mentor:</strong> Kyle Chard (University of Chicago)</p>
<p><strong>Additional Mentor:</strong> Ben Blaiszik/Logan Ward (University of Chicago / Argonne National Laboratory)</p>
<p><strong>Necessary Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Programming experience (Ideally with Python)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desirable Skills / Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience with data analysis toolkits (e.g., Python Pandas, SciPy, R)</li>
<li>Some experience with statistical modelling and/or machine learning</li>
<li>Basic knowledge of materials science</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Jupyter notebooks that reproduce published results using data contained in
   MDF</li>
<li>Published models, notebooks, and derived data</li>
<li>New models created from mixing several MDF datasets</li>
<li>Conversion and ingestion of existing materials datasets into MDF</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p>There is a vast amount of materials science data (computational or
experimental) available in repositories such as the Materials Data Facility
(MDF), Materials Project, AFLOWLib, Citrination, and NOMAD, among others. While
much of these data has been analyzed in isolation, little have been used
collectively to develop new models and drive new discovery. In this project,
the student will develop methods for accessing data contained within the MDF
and other repositories directly from within Jupyter notebooks. Such a tool will
enable better reproducibility and easier re-use for the increasingly common
machine learning models created from materials data.</p>
<p>After developing a model to access data, the student will then work to recreate
several machine learning methods from the literature to explore these datasets,
and then branch to applying these tools to new data. For example, the student
will implement models that determine whether metallic alloys can be formed as
glasses (see figure below). Having implemented these models and reproduced
published results, the student will apply the underlying model to a wider range
of data contained in the MDF. At this point, there are several possible routes
for continuing the project, including benchmarking several machine learning
methods using the same datasets or exploring how to best mix different data
sources to train a single model. As a result of this work, the student will
publish the resulting notebooks, models, and derived data in the MDF such that
others can discover, reproduce, and build upon their work.</p>

<p>Ability of different alloy compositions to form a metallic glass as (a)
measured experimentally and (b) predicted with a machine learning model.
Without being provided any data from the experimental data shown in (a), the
model correctly identifies the locations of the two glass-forming regions in
the Al-Ni-Zr alloy system. Ref: Ward et al. npj Compt. Mater.</span> (2016),

<p><strong>Necessary Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>R programming experience</li>
<li>Interest in developing tools and methods for empowering researchers in the
   data-intensive natural and social sciences</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Desirable Skills / Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Competency developing and running software, managing data, and automating
   workflows via scripts on multiple computing platforms (ideally including
   MacOS, Linux, and Windows; cloud-based computing environments in addition
   would be a plus).</li>

</ul>
<p><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive browser-based environment for browsing, querying, and
   visualizing the comprehensive history of a single PaleoCAR [BK14]
   study.</li>
<li>Based on this concrete example, a conceptual template for representing the
   full provenance of any research study carried out using WT tools and
   environments.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this project is to create an integrated representation of all
dimensions of the provenance of the results of particular scientific study. The
study will employ PaleoCAR [BK14] to reconstruct environmental conditions of a
particular paleoenvironment.</p>
<p>The elements of the resulting comprehensive provenance model of this PaleoCAR
study will include:  (1) graphical, queryable representations of each of the
computational workflows enacted as part of the research and corresponding to
the prospective provenance all data products generated during the study; (2)
the retrospective provenance of each such intermediate and final data product
complete with records of the specific program executions involved, the values
of program arguments applied, and--where possible--the values of key variables
within the programs themselves as exposed by YesWorkflow [YW];  (3) the
provenance of all data used by the study but obtained from sources outside the
study including public data repositories; (4) the intellectual and scholarly
lineage of the scientific, computational, and statistical methods employed in
the study; (5) the provenance and dependencies of all software programs,
libraries, and components used in the study; and (6) the network of connections
between the preceding 5 categories of provenance, e.g. the chains of citations
to scientific literature reporting the invention, evaluation, and application
of the methods and software components used in the study.</p>
<p>We expect that this project will yield insights into what new tools researchers
need, and what new capabilities must to be added to the tools and environments
they already use, if we are to make it easy for them to present their studies
in the context of the rich, integrated provenance this project will illustrate.</p>

<h4>Project #3: Understanding Requirements for Infrastructure to Promote Reproducible Research</h4>
<p><strong>Primary Mentor:</strong> Peter Darch (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)</p>
<p><strong>Additional Mentor:</strong> Victoria Stodden (University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign)</p>
<p><strong>Necessary Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<p>This project is suitable for students in, or graduates of, library and
information science degree programs.</p>
<p><strong>Desirable Skills / Qualifications:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Academic courses about scientific information (such as data curation, or
   scientific communication practices)</li>
<li>Experience with working in scientific information management settings or
   scientific collaboration</li>
<li>Experience with conducting qualitative research (interviews, observation)</li>
<li>Experience with requirements analysis (particularly use case approaches) for
   software and systems engineering</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Expected Outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Report on information practices and needs of a team of scientific researchers</li>
<li>Recommendations for improving information practices within this team</li>
<li>A series of use cases representing this team’s requirements for
   infrastructure to promote reproducible research.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Project Description:</strong></p>
<p>The task of building infrastructure that supports and promotes reproducible
science involves addressing multiple challenges. One major challenge involves
understanding the existing practices and requirements of the domain researchers
for whom the infrastructure will be built. Developing this understanding is
critical for: identifying where infrastructure development is best targeted;
specifying what features should be incorporated into this infrastructure; and
ensuring that researchers are able to integrate this infrastructure easily into
their work practices.</p>
<p>This project will involve studying a team of researchers from one of the Whole
Tale Science Pathways domains (astronomy, archaeology, material science,
biology/genomics, social science, disaster resilience): the particular domain
will be selected to closely match with your own interests/background.</p>
<p>You will work with the research team to learn about their work and information
practices. These practices include: how they produce, manage, and use data and
software; whether and how they make their data and software accessible to
others; and their associated record-keeping practices. Your work will involve
interviewing team members about their practices, and observing them at
work.</p>
<p>After identifying the team’s existing information practices, you will explore
what infrastructure and practices could make this team’s work more
reproducible. In addition, you may also identify particular barriers and
challenges to introducing new infrastructure and practices into the work
practices of the team.</p>
<p>Based on your findings, you will formulate a series of use cases. These use
cases will represent your findings to software engineers who are building
infrastructure to promote reproducible research.</p>
