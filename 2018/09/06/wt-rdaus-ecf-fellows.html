    <p>The Whole Tale project, in cooperation with the US region of the Research Data Alliance (RDA/US) and its <a href="http://us.rd-alliance.org/early-programs-fellowship">early career fellowship program RDA/US Data Share</a>, invites applications for the joint WT-RDA/US Early Career fellowship program. Through self-directed projects or discussions fellows will engage with both the WT and RDA communities to explore issues related to reproducibility, provenance, sharing, and citation in computational research that combines software and data.</p>
<p>The program offers two kinds of awards:
* Project Fellows (Project + Travel): Up to 3 applicants will receive a $5,000 stipend over a 6 month period and travel support to attend the RDA Thirteenth Plenary and 2019 WT Working Group workshop.
* Travel Fellows (Travel only): Up to 7 applicants will receive travel support to attend the RDA Thirteenth Plenary </p>
<p>Please carefully examine requirements and eligibility before applying. Applicants are also encouraged to study <a href="https://rd-alliance.org/">RDA</a>, <a href="http://us.rd-alliance.org/">RDA/US</a> and <a href="https://www.wholetale.org">WT</a> websites and relevant materials.</p>
<h3>Project Fellows</h3>
<p>Project Fellows will propose a 6-month project relevant to the WT and RDA goals and communities. Fellows must identify one WT Working Group and one RDA Working or Interest Group in which they will participate during the Fellowship.</p>
<p>For example, projects might explore questions such as:
* What are the challenges of publishing, sharing, citing, and re-using large-scale astronomy and astrophysics simulation datasets?
* What are the challenges of publishing and reproducing analyses conducted using machine learning in materials science and how can benchmark datasets be provided to improve the state of the art of model reproducibility?
* How do composite research objects (data + code + environment) such as "Tales" fit into existing models of publication and citation?
* What are the data sources and environments that would be needed to  support a particular community or domain?
* How do systems such as Whole Tale fit into the end-to-end publication process -- from researcher to reader?</p>
<p><em>Eligibility</em>: The program seeks doctoral students who have completed all coursework, postdoctoral students, or early career researchers who are no more than 3 years since receipt of their degree. Applicants must hold current appointment at a US-based institution. Applications from traditionally underserved populations are strongly encouraged. </p>
<p><em>Criteria for selection</em>: Applicants are sought from a variety of backgrounds, including communications, social, natural and physical sciences, business, informatics, and computer science. The Program will look for a T-shaped skill set, where early signs of cross discipline competency and interest in data are combined with a deep competency in one discipline.</p>
<p><em>Additional criteria include</em>: Benefit to the applicant’s career trajectory, interest in and commitment to reproducibility, data sharing and open access; demonstrated ability to work in teams and to show results within a short framework.</p>
<p><em>To apply</em>: Interested candidates are invited to submit their applications as follows:
* Prepare 1-2 page statement that describes a) the proposed project along with a timeline, b) benefit to career trajectory, and c) which WT and RDA Working or Interest Groups you will participate during fellowship.
* Complete application form and attach your CV and statement <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/A441JKwvzwSlapyI3">https://goo.gl/forms/A441JKwvzwSlapyI3</a></p>

<h3>Travel Fellows</h3>
<p>Travel Fellows will experiment with new ways of analyzing data and delivering results using the <a href="https://dashboard.wholetale.org">WT system</a> , optionally participate in WT Working Group discussions, attend RDA Plenary 13 in Philadelphia, PA and write a report about their experience to be publicly disseminated across WT and RDA communities.</p>
<p><em>Eligibility</em>: The program seeks graduate students at any level, postdoctoral students, or early career researchers. All applicants must hold current appointment at a US-based institution and be no more than three years beyond receipt of their degree.  Applications from traditionally underserved populations are strongly encouraged. </p>
<p><em>Criteria for selection</em>: Applicants are sought from a variety of backgrounds, including communications, social, natural and physical sciences, business, informatics, and computer science.</p>
<p><em>Additional criteria include</em>: Benefit to the applicant’s career trajectory and interest in and commitment to reproducibility, data sharing and open access.</p>
<p><em>To apply</em>: Interested candidates are invited to submit their applications as follows:
* Prepare 1 page statement that describes a) how your interests fit with the goals of WT and RDA communities and b) how this fellowship will benefit your career trajectory.
* Complete application form and attach your CV and statement <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/A441JKwvzwSlapyI3">https://goo.gl/forms/A441JKwvzwSlapyI3</a></p>
