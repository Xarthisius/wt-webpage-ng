## Project Description

This project will explore developing a custom front-end for volumetric (i.e., astrophysical, oceanographic, weather, finite element) data accessible to Whole Tale.  This will include developing a dashboard of analysis methods on these datasets, and utilizing existing open source libraries for exposing methods to individuals.  The final result will be both a dashboard and a downloadable set of machine-readable representations of the current state of the dashboard, which can be re-ingested as a secondary tale.

## Necessary Prerequisites:

 * Experience with scientific datasets
 * Experience with Jupyter, or alternately, web technologies for visualization such as vega, D3, leaflet, etc.
 * Experience with version control systems such as git

## Desirable Skills / Qualifications:

 * Experience with python-based tools for data analysis, such as numpy, yt, dask, and xarray.
 * Experience with Jupyter dashboards (such as voila) and declarative user interface systems (such as SwiftUI, ipywidgets, etc)
 * Domain knowledge in one or more areas of the natural sciences such as astronomy, weather, oceanography, seismology, etc.

## Expected Outcomes:

 * General deliverables:
    * presentation
    * weekly meetings
    * blog post
    * git repository
 * Specific deliverables
    * template tale
    * dashboard specification
