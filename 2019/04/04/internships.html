    <p>The Whole Tale is inviting Internship applications for 2019!</p>
<p>The act of sharing scientific knowledge is rapidly evolving away from
traditional articles and presentations to the delivery of executable objects
that integrate the data and computational details (e.g., scripts and workflows)
upon which the findings rely. This envisioned coupling of data and process is
essential to advancing science. The WholeTale project aims to connect
computational, data-intensive research efforts with the larger research
process - transforming the knowledge discovery and dissemination process into
one where data products are united with research articles to create "living
publications" or tales.</p>
<p>WholeTale: <em>Merging Science and Cyberinfrastructure Pathways</em> is an NSF-funded
collaboration led by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in
partnership with the University of Chicago, the University of Texas at Austin,
the University of California, Santa Barbara, and the University of Notre Dame.
We are pleased to announce the availability of summer research internships for
undergraduates, graduate students and recent postgraduates!</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>April 5</strong> - Application period opens</li>
<li><strong>May 6</strong> <del>May 3</del> - Deadline for receipt of applications</li>
<li><strong>May 16</strong> <del>May 10</del> - Notification of acceptance </li>
<li><strong>May 20</strong> - Program begins</li>
<li><strong>June 18</strong> - Midterm evaluations</li>
<li><strong>July 26</strong> - Program concludes</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact start date will be determined by the mentor in coordination with the
student to  accommodate academic calendars.</p>
<h3>Program Information</h3>
<p>Interns undertake a 10-week program of work centered around one of the projects
listed below. Each intern will be paired with a primary mentor, and possibly
with additional mentors and team members. Interns need not necessarily be at
the same location or institution as any of their mentors. Interns and mentors
are expected to have a virtual or face-to-face meeting at the beginning of the
internship, and maintain regular communication throughout the program. Interns
will be asked to share their work through an open source repository and
communicate weekly updates via a mailing list.  </p>
<h3>Project Descriptions</h3>
<p>The proposed internship projects cover a range of topic areas and vary in the
extent and type of prior background required. We expect to fund at least three
of the projects described below; the final determination will also take into
account applicants' interests and expertise.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="/internship_projects/2019-benchmarking-machine-learning-matsci.html">Benchmarking Machine Learning Methods in Materials Science</a></li>
<li><a href="/internship_projects/2019-reproducibility-levels.html">Exploring Levels of Reproducibility with Whole Tale</a></li>
<li><a href="/internship_projects/2019-analyzing-ajps.html">Analysis of Verified Replication Packages in Political Science</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>The program is open to undergraduate students, graduate students, and
postgraduates who have received their degree within the past five years. There
are no restrictions on academic backgrounds or field of study (see project
descriptions for prerequisites and desirable skills). <strong>Interns must be at least
18 years of age by the program start date, must be currently enrolled or
employed at a U.S. university or other research institution and must currently
reside in, and be eligible to work in, the United States.</strong> Interns are expected
to be available approximately 40 hours/week during the internship period with
significant availability during normal business hours. <em>The following student
populations are particularly encouraged to apply:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Students from four-year colleges without significant graduate programs.</li>
<li>Students from schools or consortia that have historically served large
   minority student populations. </li>
<li>US veterans pursuing STEM degrees.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Financial Support</h3>
<p>Interns will receive a stipend of $5,000 for participation, paid in bi-weekly
installments, administered by the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
Participation in the program after the mid-term is contingent on satisfactory
performance. For students who are not US citizens or permanent residents,
complete visa information will be required, and it may be necessary for the
funds to be paid through the student's university or research institution.
In such cases, the student will need to provide the necessary contact
information for their organization.</p>
<h3>To Apply</h3>
<p>Complete the <a href="https://forms.gle/rtrPTFotxogR6tpXA">online application</a> which
also asks you to provide the following information: </p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>cover letter</strong> identifying the project(s) you are interested in, the
contributions you expect to make to the project, relevant background, value of
the internship program to your educational and career objectives, and
disclosure of any factors that would affect your ability to participate (e.g.,
other summer employment/commitments, university schedules, etc. </li>
<li>a <strong>resume</strong> that includes educational history, current position, any publications
or honors, and full contact information (including phone number, email address,
and mailing address)</li>
</ul>
<p>We also encourage you to submit an optional letter of reference from a
professor, supervisor, or other mentor. Please ask your letter-writer to email
the reference letter directly to</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wholetale-interns-2019@googlegroups.com</code> (cc to <code>ludaesch@illinois.edu</code>). 
   The Subject should be:  <code>Summer Internship 2019: &lt;Applicant's Name&gt;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Applications must be completed and submitted <strong>no later than May 3, 2019</strong>.</p>
