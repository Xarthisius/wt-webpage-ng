      LIGO Detected Gravitational Waves from Black Holes
      On September 14, 2015 at 5:51 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time (09:51 UTC), the 
      twin Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors, 
      located in Livingston, Louisiana, and Hanford, Washington, USA both 
      measured ripples in the fabric of spacetime - gravitational waves - 
      arriving at the Earth from a cataclysmic event in the distant universe.

      Reproducing "Informatics-aided bandgap engineering for solar materials"
      This notebook shows how to replicate the main findings of a 2014 paper by
      Dey et al that used machine learning to predict the band gap energies of
      solar cell materials

  - title: Predicting the Properties of Inorganic Materials with Machine Learning
    description: |
      properties of materials. The main focus of this paper was the construction
      of general purpose method to link the composition of a material (i.e., the
      fractions of each element) to its properties, which they found can be used
      for as applications such as identifying candidate solar cell materials.
      The notebooks within this tale recreate the validation tests from the
      paper and how the models were used to discover new materials.

    description: |
      MaxEnt modeling for species distribution. In 2006, Phillps, Anderson and
      Shapire revisited estimation methods for probability density functions in
      order to improve predictions for species presence in a given location.
      This Tale replicates the logic and general results of the paper using the
      same datasets in a Jupyter Notebook. In addition to this Tale, one that
      uses the <i>scikit-learn</i> Python package for data analysis, a second
      Tale is under development using intros-MaxEnt, a packaged aimed at
      ecologists with better control structures.

  - title: Long-term Ecological Research Panoche Hills Ecological Reserve
    description: |
      This Tale explores <i>Ephedra california</i> as a foundation species
      within the San Joaquin Desert, California. These data specific to
      Panoche Hills Ecological Reserve. Meta-data provided with published data,
      and most measures are self-evident and standard protocols for research
      team. However, canopy decadence is not the typical Likert net 1-10 scale.
      It can vary from 1-10, but this score is estimated by breaking each
      canopy, visually into 5 segments, the four cardinal directions and top,
      and scoring each as 0 for dead, 1 partial, and 2 for all alive.

  - title: What is Whole Tale?
    name: what-wt
    content: |
      Whole Tale is an NSF-funded Data Infrastructure Building Block (DIBBS)
      initiative to build a scalable, open source, web-based, multi-user
      platform for reproducible research enabling the creation, publication, and
      execution of tales - executable research objects that capture data, code,
      and the complete software environment used to produce research findings.
      
      <p>A beta version of the system is available at https://dashboard.wholetale.org.</p>

      The Whole Tale platform has been designed based on community input
      primarily through working groups and collaborations with researchers.

      <p>The Whole Tale project is involved in several initiatives to train
      researchers for reproducibility as well as use of Whole Tale in the
      classroom.</p>

  - title: Why Whole Tale?
    name: why-wt
    content: |
      Virtually all published discoveries today have data and computational
      components. There is a mismatch between traditional scientific
      dissemination practices and modern computational research practice that leads
      to reproducibility concerns. The Whole Tale platform supports
      computational reproducibility by enabling researchers to create and
      package code, data and information about the workflow and computational
      environment necessary to support review and reproduce results of
      computational analysis that are reported in published research. Whole Tale
      implements this definition by supporting explicit citation of externally
      referenced data, capturing the artifacts and provenance information needed
      to facilitate understanding, transparency, and execution of the
      computational processes and workflows used for review and reproducibility
      at the time of publication.

  - title: What is a Tale?
    name: what-tale
    content: |
      A <i>tale</i> is an <b>executable research object</b> that combines data
      (references), code (computational methods), computational environment, and
      narrative (traditional science story). Tales are captured in a
      standards-based format complete with metadata. The Tale stores explicit
      references to data and code used in computational experiments, both for
      reproducibility purposes and to permit the citation of the specific
      versions used in any subsequent research. A Tale can be submitted (e.g.
      published) to an external research repository and assigned a persistent
      identifier by the repository. The Whole Tale platform allows users to
      interactively create and edit Tales and to re-run a Tale to reproduce and
      verify results as obtained by the original Tale creator.
